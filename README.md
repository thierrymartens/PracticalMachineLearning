# PracticalMachineLearning

It still seems that the html page is not showing in the correct format (sigh)....

What DOES seem to work is to go to http://htmlpreview.github.io/
and there paste the following link:
https://github.com/thierrymartens/PracticalMachineLearning/blob/master/Practical_Machine_Learning_Project.html

which seems to show a nice & correct html page...
